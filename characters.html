              Jerry Orbach played stuborn but vigilant Detective Lennie Briscoe
              from seasons 4-14 until he left the show due to health issues.
              Arguably the face of the franchise, Lennie's snide remarks often
              took the form of memorable one-liners that defined the show.
              Although he had built a very sucessful career in Police work,
              Lennie was no stranger to trouble with the Law, as the
              devorcee's daughter was killed in a drug incident in season nine.

              The longest tenured member of the original cast, Adam Schiff
              served ten years as the District Attorney for the City of
              New York. His well conected sphere of influence from years of
              serving as both an ADA and judge made him widely respected.
              A calm and careful thinker, Adam Schiff never rushed to conclusions
              and always considered his all of his options before making
              a decision. Frequently he had to restrain the bit-of-a-loose-
              cannon in Jack McCoy and he always served as a role model to
              McCoy. Responsible for maintaining fair and equal prosecution
              Schiff never wavered and had impecable judgement. After more than
              a decade as the District Attorney, Adam Schiff retired to help
              maintain the rights of those who needed them the most.

              Beginning her tenure as the Capitan of the Precinct in Season 4,
              Anita van Buren led one of the most sucessful and well organized
              precincts in Manhattan. Known by many for her stern yet fair
              leadership, Van Buren recieved multiple awards for her work for
              the city and the NYPD. Often, when her detectives were unable
              to connect with a suspect, she stepped in without missing a beat.
              In addition to having a great relationship with her detectives
              and other members of the Precinct, Van Buren had a strong
              friendship with Jack McCoy and the District Attorneys office.
              In leadding a no nonsense opperation, she showed an incredible
              sense of dedication to her job and to her coworkers. In addition
              to her strong work ethic, her striking intellegence often shined
              through when she was needed the most.

            <h4>Detective Mike Logan</h4>

              An original member of the Law and Order Cast, Detective Mike
              Logan served for five years and with three different partners.
              In only two years, both his original parter and his replacment
              were injured on the job and were forced to retire to desk jobs
              within the Police force. Logan had a firey temper and often cared
              little for the comfort of suspects. Often stating his mind rather
              than swallowing his pride, Detective Logan was no strnager to
              conflict. Often not given the respect he deserved due to his age,
              he certainly wasn't shy to let his coworkers and superiors know
              how he really felt.
