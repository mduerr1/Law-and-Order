              Beginning his Law and Order tenure in Season 5, ADA Jack McCoy
              prosecuted criminals for more than a decade. Folliwing his tenure
              as an ADA, Jack McCoy became the District Attorney, replacing his
              predecessor Arthur Branch. Known for his passion for his job
              and dedication to the law, Jack McCoy followed a strong moral
              compass and never rested until his duty to justice was fulfilled.

              Jerry Orbach played stubborn but vigilant Detective Lennie Briscoe
              from seasons 4-14 until he left the show due to health issues.
              Arguably the face of the franchise, Lennie's snide remarks often
              took the form of memorable one-liners that defined the show.
              Although he had built a very successful career in police work,
              Lennie was no stranger to trouble with the Law, as the
              divorc√©'s daughter was killed in a drug related incident in
              season nine.

              The longest tenured member of the original cast, Adam Schiff
              served ten years as the District Attorney for the City of
              New York. His well connected sphere of influence from years of
              serving as an ADA made him widely respected.
              A calm and careful thinker, Adam Schiff never rushed to conclusions
              and always considered all of his options before making
              a decision. Frequently he had to restrain the loose
              cannon in Jack McCoy, whom he served as a role model.
              Responsible for maintaining fair and equal prosecution
              Schiff never wavered and had impeccable judgement. After more than
              a decade as the District Attorney, Adam Schiff retired to help
              maintain the rights of those who needed them the most.

            <h4>Captain Anita Van Buren</h4>
            <p>
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Epatha_Merkerson"><img src="https://cimg.tvgcdn.net/i/2010/04/01/dd9ecdac-2ec8-4c70-88f4-95a209605b42/7e075d58d08b57e159fe002b6ef2ab12/100331sepathamerkerson_laworder1.jpg" class="right" alt="Anita Van Buren"></a>
              Beginning her tenure as the Precinct Captain in Season 4,
              Anita van Buren led one of the most successful and well organized
              precincts in Manhattan. Known by many for her stern yet fair
              leadership, Van Buren received multiple awards for her work for
              the city and the NYPD. Often, when her detectives were unable
              to connect with a suspect, she stepped in without missing a beat.
              In addition to having a great relationship with her detectives
              and other members of the Precinct, Van Buren had a strong
              friendship with Jack McCoy and the District Attorney's office.
              In leading a no nonsense operation, she showed an incredible
              sense of dedication to her job and coworkers. In addition
              to her strong work ethic, her striking intelligence often shined
              through when she was needed the most.

            <h4>Detective Mike Logan</h4>

              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Noth"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/55/Mike_Logan_-_Law_Order_-_Prescription_for_Death.jpg/220px-Mike_Logan_-_Law_Order_-_Prescription_for_Death.jpg" class="left" alt="Mike Logan"></a>
              An original member of the Law and Order Cast, Detective Mike
              Logan served for five years with three different partners.
              In only two years, both his original partner and his replacement
              were injured on the job and were forced to retire to desk jobs.
              Logan had a firey temper and often cared
              little for the comfort of suspects. Often stating his mind rather
              than swallowing his pride, Detective Logan was no stranger to
              conflict. Frequently not given the respect he deserved due to his age,
              he certainly wasn't afraid to let his coworkers and superiors know
              how he really felt.
