      The original Law and Order series spanned more than 20 years and
      was watched and beloved by millions.
      One of the most well-known and popular shows throughout the late nineties
      and early two thousands, Dick Wolf's cinematic omniverse includes
      several other Law and Order spinoffs and and even a movie. With its
      popularity the series featured a number of famous actors, politicians,
      and profesional athletes.

      Most episodes followed a similar format, where prior to the intro
      the crime is established and after the title card
      the detectives begin their investigation. Around half way through
      the episode, the Police turn over their suspect to the District
      Attorneys who then prosecute the case. Written by dozens of screenwriters,
      each epsiode is both unique and original. In more than 450 episodes
      Law and Order explores a wide variety of different themes as
      relevant today as they were when they first aired.
